A to Z ui

1. Technologies

   Html - Skeleton of the website all words and paragraphs without styling

   Css- Adds design and styling to the site

   Less- compiles the css down so we can do more with it like use variables and mixins

   Javascript- Adds functionality and makes the site interactive.

2. Basic Thought Process

   First I had to get a rough idea of how I wanted the site to look.

   I started with the header and creating links to login and sign up.

   For the main body of the site I started off with lorem ipsum filler text to get a better visual representation

3. Functionality

   Added tabs component for a little functionality for the user. Makes it easier to click through team members.

   Also added bootstrap library based on rubric we need a library or framework.
   So I used bootstrap to do the experiences page. But it took me a while to make it not look like it was bootstrap.

   Used the map method in javascript to get the tabs up and working.

   My reusable component is the tabs in the about page.

4) Mobile Responsiveness

   Made sure the whole site was mobile responsive at 800px and 500px.
